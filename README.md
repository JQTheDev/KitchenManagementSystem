Kitchen Management System

In this project I am making a management system designed for institutions to keep better track of their stock and meals.
This application is specifically designed for institutions that rely on variable funding from donaters with a fixed funding amount being from the government.
I utilitise fuzzy logic as well as coding algorithms to recommend the 3 most nutritious meals out of a list of selected meals by the user. These generated meals
can be scheduled to a specific date which can be referred back to in order to keep track of what set of meals will/should be made on each day. I am using a local
DB and query this db using Entity Framework's db context in the back-end paired with RESTful API CRUD methods from my client-side to decouple the relationship between the 2.

Imporant Note: This is a working progress with commits being added a few times a week. Please keep this in mind as I continue to apply my knowledge gained from my courses
to better refine my work! The biggest factor for me is maintaining good practices in order to easily build on my knowledge. I also have a testing file (MSTesting) in which
I use Nunit to test key features of my application.
