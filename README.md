In this project, I made a management system designed for institutions to track their stock and meals better.
This application was specifically designed for institutions that rely on variable funding from donors with a fixed funding amount being from the government.
I utilised fuzzy logic and coding algorithms to recommend the 3 most nutritious meals out of a list of selected meals by the user. These generated meals
can be scheduled to a specific date, which can be referred back to to keep track of what set of meals will/should be made on each day. I am using a local
DB and query this DB using Entity Framework's DB context in the back-end, paired with RESTful API CRUD methods from my client-side to decouple the relationship between the 2.
I have used Nunit framework to rigorously test my code and ensure all functions work as expected.
